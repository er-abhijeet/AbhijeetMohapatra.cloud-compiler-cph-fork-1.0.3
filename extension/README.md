# Cloud Compiler (CPH Fork)

**⚠️ WARNING: If you have the original CPH extension installed and enabled, please disable or uninstall it and restart VSCode before installing and using this extension!**

A cloud-based competitive programming helper extension for VSCode. This extension is a fork of the original [Competitive Programming Helper (CPH)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper), but all code is compiled and run via a cloud API, making it platform-independent and easy to use without local setup.
